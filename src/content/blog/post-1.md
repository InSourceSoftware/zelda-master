# About me

Hey everybody i'm Ben/the Zelda Master, I'm 10 years old, and this is my first blog, so this will be kinda hard for me! I will be talking about me playing the game, and I will also add tips. I'm on my second account, but my first one with the DLC! I hope you have as much fun reading this as I will making this!

## My first tip

Now, for those of you who are on the Great Plateau, the hardest shrine to get to is The Cryonis Trial. Climb up the mountain next to the Shrine of Resurrection, follow the mountain top, beat the bokoblins, and it should be easy from there. You can also get the warm duble from the old man. Here is a picture of link with it on.
