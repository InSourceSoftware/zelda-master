# Towers and Shrines

There are sections of the map, and to earn them you need to actavate every tower. I will name all the towers, and tell you what part of hyrule it is in! First hebra in the northwest, tabantha, and ridgeland in the west, wastland, and gerudo in the southwest, central in the complete middle, hateno, necluda, and faron in the southeast, lake in the south, lanayru in the east, eldin, and akkala in the northeast, and woodland in the north. There are many shrines in the game to! They all have a certain trial theme. Like water, or fire, or wind, or electricity, or evan fighting!
