# The Classic Link Outfit

So some of you might have played other Zelda games and know what outfit link used to have on. In the legend of Zelda Breath of The Wild that is not his main outfit, but there is a way to get it, bit it will be a challenge, so listen good. First complete all the shrines all 120 not including the 16 DLC ones after that go to the forgotten temple there is a shrine there walk to the giant goddess statue on the platform below you will see three chests open them, and boom! I sugest you dye them blue.
